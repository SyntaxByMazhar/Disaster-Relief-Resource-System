# Disaster Response & Relief Resource System (DRRS)

A console-based Disaster Management System developed in C++ as a Programming Fundamentals semester project.



##  Project Overview

The Disaster Response & Relief Resource System (DRRS) is designed to help manage disaster-related resources and affected areas efficiently.  

The system allows users to store, update, and allocate resources based on disaster severity levels.

This project demonstrates real-world application of core Programming Fundamentals concepts.


## Features

###  Resource Management
- Add resources
- View resources
- Update resource quantities
- File-based storage

###  Affected Area Management
- Add area details
- View areas
- Update severity level
- File-based storage

###  Allocation Module
- Severity-based allocation suggestions
- Shortage warnings
- Allocation logging

###  Reporting & Summary
- View allocation report
- System summary (total resources & areas)
- Persistent data using text files


##  Programming Concepts Used

- Variables & Data Types
- Conditions
- Loops
- Arrays
- Structures
- User-defined Functions
- File Handling
- Menu-driven Programming


## How to Compile and Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o drrs
drrs

##  Project Structure

- `main.cpp` → Main program source code  
- `resources.txt` → Stores resource data  
- `areas.txt` → Stores affected area data  
- `allocations.txt` → Stores allocation reports
